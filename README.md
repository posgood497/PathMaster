# PathMaster v. 2.0! Now navigates using diagonals!

INTRO: PathMaster is a program that will find a path through a user-generated maze.

INSTALL: Create project in your favorite java IDE (I used netbeans) named PathMaster, copy files to src folder. Bulid project and run.

SOME TECH JARGON: The system is written in Java and the GUI was written using the JavaFX library. With this project I studied and utilized the A* algorithm. I used the "City Block" aka. Manhattan Heuristic to calculate distance from goal.
